      " \n",
      "1. Preparing a sound traffic and revenue study \n",
      "Forecasting the socioeconomic trends and \n",
      "fluctuations in transportation patterns and mode \n",
      "choices that will influence demand for a proposed \n",
      "near-border facility are enormously challenging. \n",
      "Public owners have access to U.S. Census Bureau \n",
      "data and other resources to help forecast those \n",
      "characteristics for U.S. motorists, but getting that \n",
      "data is only half of the battle for near-border \n",
      "facilities. Accessing similar information from \n",
      "the neighboring country is much more difficult,  \n",
      "if not impossible.  \n",
      " \n",
      "− Include reasonable assumptions. The city or \n",
      "metropolitan planning organization will have \n",
      "models, containing information about traffic \n",
      "generated from the neighboring country, as well \n",
      "as future growth and development in the area. \n",
      "Whatever those assumptions are, apply tolling to \n",
      "them and plug them into the T&R report. Owners \n",
      "also should conduct sufficient sensitivity testing \n",
      "of the assumptions to better understand the \n",
      "dynamics of the transportation system over the \n",
      "course of the transportation investment. If \n",
      "defendable and reasonable, these assumptions \n",
      "and sensitivity results will help to raise the \n",
      "confidence levels of rating agencies and \n",
      "investors.  \n",
      " \n",
      "− Highlight historic trends. The typical investment-\n",

      "origin and destination study. But reports for  \n",

      " \n",
      "near-border facilities will need to go into much \n",
      "more detail about the makeup of users and the \n",
      "frequency of their trips. Owners should factor \n",
      "into their reports any historic trends of toll \n",
      "facilities in the same area.  \n",
      " \n",
      "− Segment the business rules. The owner will have \n",
      "to provide extensive detail about its revenue \n",
      "capture strategy. For near-border facilities, this \n",
      "strategy is much more influential than for other \n",
      "toll facilities with more “predictable” users. The \n",
      "owner will need to draft strong business rules  \n",
      "for each type of user and detail how the agency  \n",
      "will communicate and enforce those rules. \n",
      " \n",
      "− Seek best practices. Public owners will need  \n",
      "to cite specific steps they will take to mitigate \n",
      "leakage from international users. Because a \n",
      "depth of knowledge does not exist on this topic \n",
      "for U.S. agencies, one best practice is to ask \n",
      "other owners with similar facilities for their \n",
      "policies, procedures, benchmark collection  \n",
      "rates and demographic profiles. \n",
      " \n",
      "− Estimate conservatively. A near-border facility \n",
      "cannot approach the financial market with an \n",
      "inflated or unrealistic revenue capture rate. \n",
      "Investors and rating agencies will not have faith \n",
      "in them or the overall soundness of the toll plan. \n",
      "To instill in the financial market the greatest \n",

      "viewed by some as the best collection method for \n",
      "near-border facilities because they act as natural \n",
      "deterrents to violators. However, traditional \n",
      "collection methods may not be practical in every \n",
      "situation. For example, if an owner is adding new \n",
      "capacity to an existing congested highway in a \n",
      "heavily developed urban area, the necessary right  \n",
      "of way may not exist to accommodate the wider \n",
      "roads traditional toll plazas require. Or, the cash-\n",
      "strapped public owner may lack the financial \n",
      "resources necessary to pay the additional capital \n",
      "and operational costs of traditional toll plazas.  \n",
      "In this situation, the public owner may be willing to \n",
      "trade a sizeable leakage rate for the higher traffic \n",
      "volumes, lower capital outlay, potentially reduced \n",
      "operating costs and increased environmental \n",

      " \n",
      "Would video tolling, as a backup system to  \n",
      "all-electronic tolling, help increase the revenue \n",
      "capture rates? It would increase domestic revenue \n",
      "capture, but it will not necessarily increase the \n",
      "capture rate of international customers. Unless the \n",
      "owner has a legal agreement of reciprocity with the \n",
      "neighboring country, video tolling’s usefulness stops \n",
      "at the border. U.S. toll agencies cannot access \n",
      "contact information of foreign nationals nor do they \n",
      "have the authority to enforce payment beyond their \n",
      "states’ borders. \n",
      " \n",
      "Today, no U.S. toll agency or department of \n",
      "transportation has such an agreement with Mexico \n",
      "or Canada. Such an unprecedented partnership \n",
      "would be classified as an international affair, \n",
      "requiring the involvement of multiple U.S. federal \n",
      "government agencies, local and federal agencies  \n",
      "of the neighboring country and a significant \n",
      "investment of time and resources on the  \n",
      "owner’s part. In the meantime, owners may want  \n",
      "to consider other proactive steps to curb or offset \n",
      "leakage, such as: \n",
      " \n",
      "− Launching an extensive communications \n",
      "campaign in both English and the language  \n",
      "of the international target audience. Stress the \n",
      "benefits of using the facility and being a toll tag \n",
      "customer. \n",
      " \n",
      "− Making the toll tags easy to purchase and \n",
      "replenish. Installing toll tag kiosks, either  \n",
      "in popular retail chains frequented by \n",
      "international customers or in locations  \n",
      "near ports of entry, is a smart option.  \n",
      " \n",
      "− Permitting anonymous toll tag accounts. These \n",
      "tags could be purchased and refilled with cash by \n",
      "customers who do not have major credit cards, \n",
      "U.S. debit cards or U.S. bank accounts. \n",
      " \n",
      "− Integrating the toll tag with other transportation \n",
      "elements. Allow customers to use their toll tags \n",
      "to pay for parking at nearby airports, in city \n",
      "parking garages and at stadiums.  \n",
      " \n",
      "− Giving away toll tags as a promotion. If a large \n",
      "percentage of the facility’s international users \n",
      "will be frequent customers, this could be an \n",
      "effective strategy to broaden distribution and \n",
      "encourage compliance.  \n",
      " \n",
      "− Offering shuttle service. If vehicle ownership is \n",
      "low among residents in the neighboring foreign \n",
      "city, the public owner might consider offering \n",
      "shuttle service on its toll route. The shuttle then  \n",
      " \n",
      "page 4 \n",
      " \n",
      "− could link with other modes of transportation, \n",
      "such as buses, streetcars, light-rail, etc., to \n",
      "improve connectivity within the city.  \n",
      " \n",
      "− Expediting U.S. entry of commercial traffic. \n",
      "Foster an agreement with U.S. border inspection \n",
      "facility managers to dedicate a lane exclusively \n",
      "for commercial vehicles with toll tags, offering \n",
      "those customers faster entry and exit and \n",
      "greater incentive for compliance. Inspection \n",
      "charges could be combined with toll rates, \n",
      "allowing customers to pay a single fee.  \n",
      " \n",
      "− Increasing non-toll revenue, such as: \n",
      "o Selling advertising space on bridges or \n",
      "dynamic message signs. \n",
      "o Offering sponsorships of service plazas, toll \n",
      "holidays, motorist-assist vehicles and park-n-\n",
      "ride lots.  \n",
      "o Leasing easements for cell phone towers and \n",
      "fiber optic cable lines, which generate revenue \n",
      "and benefit the facility’s operations.  \n",
      "o Offering retail sales at the facility, such as \n",
      "food, merchandise, etc. \n",
      " \n",
      "− Sharing development costs with adjacent \n",
      "communities, developers and corporations that \n",
      "will benefit from the toll facility.  \n",
      " \n",
      "3. Enforcing compliance across the border \n",
      " \n",
      "Identifying international violators and preventing \n",
      "them from accessing the toll facility is a tremendous \n",
      "challenge. Overcoming it will require public owners \n",
      "to think creatively and forge new partnerships with: \n",
      " \n",
      "− Local law enforcement. Owners may want to \n",
      "consider stationing patrol vehicles equipped  \n",
      "with license plate readers along the route.  \n",
      "These readers can scan hundreds of plates at a \n",
      "time and compare them with a database of repeat \n",
      "violators. The legal actions an officer can take \n",
      "once he or she has stopped a vehicle depends \n",
      "on the facility’s business rules and state statutes.   \n",
      " \n",
      "− \n",
      "The U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the \n",
      "U.S Immigration and Naturalization Service. \n",
      "Perhaps these federal agencies could identify \n",
      "violators via their passports and collect \n",
      "outstanding toll violations on the spot before \n",
      "allowing the person to enter or exit the United \n",
      "States? \n",
      " \n",
      " \n",
      " \n",
      "− \n",
      "The foreign tolling counterpart or border patrol. \n",
      "Could these entities identify violators as they \n",
      "cross the border? As incentive, the U.S. public \n",
      "owner might consider offering the participating \n",
      "foreign agencies a percentage of each payment \n",
      "they collect.  \n",
      " \n",
      "It should be noted, however, that such partnerships do \n",
      "not exist and would involve a highly complex, lengthy \n",
      "process, most likely involving both federal \n",
      "governments. Chances are the public owner would  \n",
      "need to explore legislation that would allow it to flag \n",
      "repeat violators at the border and deny them entry  \n",
      "if payment for past violations is not rendered. \n",
      " \n",
      "No doubt cross-border traffic is increasing. Tolling  \n",
