chunk_0,"The HNTB Companies  Engineers  Architects  Planners  WHITE PAPER | JANUARY 2013    Tolling the line, part I  How to maximize toll revenue  near U.S. international borders  Public owners face unique and significant challenges when attempting to   maximize revenue capture on toll facilities near the Mexican or Canadian border.     In this white paper, three of the most problematic areas:   • Submitting a confident T&R report or a conservative one?   Which is best and why?  • Pros and cons of electronic toll collection versus manual collection.  • Extending enforcement beyond the border — a new frontier.      page 2    More near-border toll facilities   in the future    Residents of El Paso, Texas, or Ciudad Juárez, Mexico,  are all too familiar with traffic congestion. On the U.S.  side, near-border highways and interstates can be  jammed, creating delays, draining productivity and  hampering the flow of goods and services into and out  of the country. In fact, El Paso is the fourth busiest  truck gateway"
chunk_1,"in the United States, according to the  U.S.DOT’s Bureau of Transportation Statistics.    The gridlock is due, in part, to the North American Free  Trade Agreement, which has increased dramatically  cross-border traffic:    − Nearly 93 million personal vehicles entered the  United States in 2011, 31.6 million from Canada   and 61.2 million from Mexico, according to the BTS.    − In 2011, goods valued at more than $1.06 trillion  crossed the U.S. border in trade with the two  countries – 15 percent higher than in 2010 and   44 percent higher than 2009.    − Total trade between U.S., Canada and Mexico  increased 12 percent in 2011 from 2010.     − Among all modes, roads had the largest increase in  shipment value, $69 billion, from 2010 to 2011.     The increased trade is clogging ports of entry. In 2011,  authorities in Laredo, Texas, the top road gateway with  $117.3 billion in international road shipments, nearly  doubled the number of lanes to 15 on the World Trade  Bridge. Still, the wait to enter or exit"
chunk_2,"the United States  can be as long as six hours.    Lack of traditional funding is driving trend  No question the need for more border crossings and  expansion of near-border facilities is there, but the  funding to pay for them is not. As cash-strapped state  departments of transportation try to keep pace with  demand, many are considering tolling as a solution to  funding the mobility-enhancing projects their  constituents so desperately need.     We can see this trend playing out on both borders:     • In California, the San Diego Association of  Governments is considering a new port of entry   and four-lane state highway border crossing in   Otay Mesa.  • In El Paso, the Texas Department of Transportation is  attempting to ease congestion by implementing, in  phases, a 40-mile toll system of managed lanes and  new toll lanes along Loop 375 and Interstate 10.  • On the northern border, the cities of Detroit and  Windsor, Ontario, are a step closer to building a New  International Trade Crossing toll bridge"
chunk_3,".    Troubleshooting the three biggest challenges public  owners will face  HNTB Corporation has assisted with the development  and operation of several near-border toll facilities,  including:     • The Maine Turnpike  • The Detroit Windsor Tunnel  • The South Bay Expressway (State Route 125)   in San Diego  • Border-crossing civil and traffic engineering at the  Lake Champlain facilities in upstate New York    From those experiences, we have identified three  problematic areas in maximizing toll revenue on a   near-border toll project:     1. Preparing a sound traffic and revenue study  Forecasting the socioeconomic trends and  fluctuations in transportation patterns and mode  choices that will influence demand for a proposed  near-border facility are enormously challenging.  Public owners have access to U.S. Census Bureau  data and other resources to help forecast those  characteristics for U.S. motorists, but getting that  data is only half of the battle for near-border  facilities. Accessing similar info"
chunk_4,"rmation from  the neighboring country is much more difficult,   if not impossible.     − Include reasonable assumptions. The city or  metropolitan planning organization will have  models, containing information about traffic  generated from the neighboring country, as well  as future growth and development in the area.  Whatever those assumptions are, apply tolling to  them and plug them into the T&R report. Owners  also should conduct sufficient sensitivity testing  of the assumptions to better understand the  dynamics of the transportation system over the  course of the transportation investment. If  defendable and reasonable, these assumptions  and sensitivity results will help to raise the  confidence levels of rating agencies and  investors.     − Highlight historic trends. The typical investment- grade traffic and revenue report contains an  origin and destination study. But reports for   page 3    near-border facilities will need to go into much  more detail about the makeup of users and the  frequency"
chunk_5,"of their trips. Owners should factor  into their reports any historic trends of toll  facilities in the same area.     − Segment the business rules. The owner will have  to provide extensive detail about its revenue  capture strategy. For near-border facilities, this  strategy is much more influential than for other  toll facilities with more “predictable” users. The  owner will need to draft strong business rules   for each type of user and detail how the agency   will communicate and enforce those rules.    − Seek best practices. Public owners will need   to cite specific steps they will take to mitigate  leakage from international users. Because a  depth of knowledge does not exist on this topic  for U.S. agencies, one best practice is to ask  other owners with similar facilities for their  policies, procedures, benchmark collection   rates and demographic profiles.    − Estimate conservatively. A near-border facility  cannot approach the financial market with an  inflated or unrealistic revenue capture r"
chunk_6,"ate.  Investors and rating agencies will not have faith  in them or the overall soundness of the toll plan.  To instill in the financial market the greatest  confidence in a proposed facility and its  management, owners should be realistic and  honest in their reporting of both the assumptions,  sensitivities and anticipated results.    2. Determining the best toll collection method.   Brick-and-mortar toll plazas and toll booths are  viewed by some as the best collection method for  near-border facilities because they act as natural  deterrents to violators. However, traditional  collection methods may not be practical in every  situation. For example, if an owner is adding new  capacity to an existing congested highway in a  heavily developed urban area, the necessary right   of way may not exist to accommodate the wider  roads traditional toll plazas require. Or, the cash- strapped public owner may lack the financial  resources necessary to pay the additional capital  and operational costs of traditional t"
chunk_7,"oll plazas.   In this situation, the public owner may be willing to  trade a sizeable leakage rate for the higher traffic  volumes, lower capital outlay, potentially reduced  operating costs and increased environmental  friendliness of all-electronic tolling.       Would video tolling, as a backup system to   all-electronic tolling, help increase the revenue  capture rates? It would increase domestic revenue  capture, but it will not necessarily increase the  capture rate of international customers. Unless the  owner has a legal agreement of reciprocity with the  neighboring country, video tolling’s usefulness stops  at the border. U.S. toll agencies cannot access  contact information of foreign nationals nor do they  have the authority to enforce payment beyond their  states’ borders.    Today, no U.S. toll agency or department of  transportation has such an agreement with Mexico  or Canada. Such an unprecedented partnership  would be classified as an international affair,  requiring the involvement of multi"
chunk_8,"ple U.S. federal  government agencies, local and federal agencies   of the neighboring country and a significant  investment of time and resources on the   owner’s part. In the meantime, owners may want   to consider other proactive steps to curb or offset  leakage, such as:    − Launching an extensive communications  campaign in both English and the language   of the international target audience. Stress the  benefits of using the facility and being a toll tag  customer.    − Making the toll tags easy to purchase and  replenish. Installing toll tag kiosks, either   in popular retail chains frequented by  international customers or in locations   near ports of entry, is a smart option.     − Permitting anonymous toll tag accounts. These  tags could be purchased and refilled with cash by  customers who do not have major credit cards,  U.S. debit cards or U.S. bank accounts.    − Integrating the toll tag with other transportation  elements. Allow customers to use their toll tags  to pay for parking at nearby ai"
chunk_9,"rports, in city  parking garages and at stadiums.     − Giving away toll tags as a promotion. If a large  percentage of the facility’s international users  will be frequent customers, this could be an  effective strategy to broaden distribution and  encourage compliance.     − Offering shuttle service. If vehicle ownership is  low among residents in the neighboring foreign  city, the public owner might consider offering  shuttle service on its toll route. The shuttle then     page 4    − could link with other modes of transportation,  such as buses, streetcars, light-rail, etc., to  improve connectivity within the city.     − Expediting U.S. entry of commercial traffic.  Foster an agreement with U.S. border inspection  facility managers to dedicate a lane exclusively  for commercial vehicles with toll tags, offering  those customers faster entry and exit and  greater incentive for compliance. Inspection  charges could be combined with toll rates,  allowing customers to pay a single fee.     − Increasing non-t"
chunk_10,"oll revenue, such as:  o Selling advertising space on bridges or  dynamic message signs.  o Offering sponsorships of service plazas, toll  holidays, motorist-assist vehicles and park-n- ride lots.   o Leasing easements for cell phone towers and  fiber optic cable lines, which generate revenue  and benefit the facility’s operations.   o Offering retail sales at the facility, such as  food, merchandise, etc.    − Sharing development costs with adjacent  communities, developers and corporations that  will benefit from the toll facility.     3. Enforcing compliance across the border    Identifying international violators and preventing  them from accessing the toll facility is a tremendous  challenge. Overcoming it will require public owners  to think creatively and forge new partnerships with:    − Local law enforcement. Owners may want to  consider stationing patrol vehicles equipped   with license plate readers along the route.   These readers can scan hundreds of plates at a  time and compare them with a data"
chunk_11,"base of repeat  violators. The legal actions an officer can take  once he or she has stopped a vehicle depends  on the facility’s business rules and state statutes.      −  The U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the  U.S Immigration and Naturalization Service.  Perhaps these federal agencies could identify  violators via their passports and collect  outstanding toll violations on the spot before  allowing the person to enter or exit the United  States?        −  The foreign tolling counterpart or border patrol.  Could these entities identify violators as they  cross the border? As incentive, the U.S. public  owner might consider offering the participating  foreign agencies a percentage of each payment  they collect.     It should be noted, however, that such partnerships do  not exist and would involve a highly complex, lengthy  process, most likely involving both federal  governments. Chances are the public owner would   need to explore legislation that would allow it to flag  repeat violators at the bor"
chunk_12,"der and deny them entry   if payment for past violations is not rendered.    No doubt cross-border traffic is increasing. Tolling   can be part of the solution in addressing the need for  enhanced mobility as long as public owners understand  and prepare for the unique risks they will face.
